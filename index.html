            <h1>Chirag Davé</h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m a freelance iOS engineer and Go programmer. I am currently building a drawing app for children. I love thinking about code, how we build things, and why. I believe the right design, from mockups to software architecture, can lead to a revolution in the mind of the end user. I find the most interesting software can expand a person's capabilities and imagination, allowing for possibilities even the creator would not have considered.</p> 
            <p>In the past my most notable client was WeTransfer, where I worked on Paper. In the Fall of 2019 I attended The Recurse Center where I made a live shader editor for MacOS, and collaborated on a web AR project for which we were awarded a grant. Further in the past, I was the second engineering hire at Grove (acquired by Wealthfront), worked on web, iOS, and search teams at Rdio (Acquired by Pandora), founded 2 startups, and was first engineering hire at UserVoice.</p> 
            <p>My personal practices are a part of who I am. I meditate and journal daily, exercise, take breaks, read, and remain committed to my curiosity and creative self. I strongly believe that working mindfully and sustainably leads to the best outcomes in all areas of life.</p> 
            <p>If you’re interested in tools for thought, creative apps, or the future of computation, I want to hear from you! I can be reached by email, or on Twitter.</p>
