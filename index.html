        <section class='about-me'>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Chirag Davé. I am a freelance iOS engineer and Metal graphics programmer. 
                I am currently building a drawing app for children. I love thinking about
                code, how we build things, and why. I believe the right design, from mockups 
                to software architecture, can lead to a revolution in the mind of the end user. 
                I find the most interesting software can expand a person's capabilities and imagination, 
                allowing for possibilities even the creator would not have considered.
            </p> 
            <p>
                In 2020 my most notable client was WeTransfer, where I worked on <a href='https://paper.bywetransfer.com/'>Paper</a>. 
                In the Fall of 2019 I attended <a href='https://www.recurse.com/'>The Recurse Center</a> where I made a live shader 
                editor called <a href='https://github.com/catilac/psychout'>PsychOut</a>, 
                and collaborated on <a href='https://github.com/catilac/carl'>CARL (Code AR Live)</a> for which we were awarded
                <a href='https://www.du.edu/ahss/opensourcearts/community'>a grant</a>. Further in the past, 
                I was the second engineering hire at <a href='https://hellogrove.com'>Grove</a> (acquired by Wealthfront), worked on web, iOS, and 
                search teams at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio'>Rdio</a> (Acquired by Pandora), founded 2 startups, 
                and was first engineering hire at <a href='https://uservoice.com/'>UserVoice</a>.
            </p> 
            <p>
                My personal practices are a big part of who I am. 
                I meditate and journal daily, exercise, and remain committed to my curiosity and creative self. 
                I strongly believe that working mindfully and sustainably leads to the best outcomes in all areas of life.
            </p> 
            <p>
                If you’re interested in tools for thought, creative apps, the 
                future of computation, or collaboration, I want to hear from you! I can be reached 
                by <a href="mailto:c@chirag.io">e-mail</a>, or on <a href='https://twitter.com/chiragdog'>Twitter.</a>
