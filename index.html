        <section class='about-me'>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Chirag Davé (she/they). I am a freelance software engineer generalist,
                apple developer, and Metal graphics programmer. I’ve worked with startups for 15 years at
                companies of different sizes, and some of my own. I’ve been the 1st engineering hire, 8th,
                and 80th (or something). While I primarily flourish as an IC, I also enjoy doing engineering
                and product management.
            </p> 

            <p>
                I love thinking about code, how we build things, and why. I believe the right design, from
                mockups to software architecture, can lead to a revolution in the mind of the end user. I
                find the most interesting software can expand a person's capabilities and imagination, allowing
                for possibilities even the creator would not have considered.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the past I worked with WeTransfer, on their <a href='https://paper.bywetransfer.com/'>Paper app.</a>
                In the Fall of 2019 I attended <a href='https://www.recurse.com/'>The Recurse Center</a> where I made a
                live shader editor called <a href='https://github.com/catilac/psychout'>PsychOut</a>, and collaborated on
                <a href='https://github.com/catilac/carl'>CARL (Code AR Live)</a> for which we were awarded a grant.

                <br />
                Further in the past, I was the second engineering hire at <a href='https://hellogrove.com'>Grove</a>
                (acquired by Wealthfront), worked on web, iOS, and search teams at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio'>Rdio</a>
                (Acquired by Pandora), founded 2 startups, and was first engineering hire at <a href='https://uservoice.com/'>UserVoice</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the past year, I’ve focused on making music and performing. I’m now attending Recurse Center for the
                second time to focus on learning DSP for VST plugin development, and embedded systems (think guitar pedals
                and hardware synthesizers). 
            </p>

            <p>
                My favorite languages are Swift, C, Go, and Javascript.
            </p>

            <p>
                My last clients involved doing work such as:
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>GPU pipeline optimization and shader implementation for an animation that responded to blood pressure readings taken by the camera in real time</li>                    
                    <li>Feature development for novel film editing software, code auditing, setting up tools for development by multiple engineers, and hiring a product manager</li>
                    <li>Porting a real time audio pitch detection library from C to swift, and then optimizing the swift code to perform just as efficiently as the C code</li>
                    <li>Helped refactor an iOS codebase built by an old school javascript developer to best practices, and using SwiftUI</li>
                    <li>Building MacOS apps using the Go programming language</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                I love to chat about music tools, effects, weird iOS and MacOS internals, and performance! I can be reached
