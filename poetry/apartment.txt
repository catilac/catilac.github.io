== The Greatest Place ==

I have been around the world
From Bombay to Halong Bay
Sri Lanka to Paris, Berlin, the UK
It is true what they say
That the greatest place on Earth 
Turns out to be my apartment

No noises from ceiling fans
No disgusting pollution
No blaring television
Only the perfect material manifestation 
Of my unlimited mind
Oh and also incense sometimes

Crawl on the floor to pick the next book
Or lay in a sunspot inspired by the last took
Contemplate my existence   
Maybe consciousness is an infinitesimal point on a 5 dimensional manifold of uniform substance!?
No doubt in my apartment
I'll figure it out
Look out the window for minutes on end
Take a break and do a back bend
Stand in the middle of the room staring into space
In my apartment thought policing has no place
