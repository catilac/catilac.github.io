                    Chirag is phenomenal on many levels: incredibly kind and enjoyable to collaborate with, able to achieve the impossible, and with a keen eye for both performance and quality of experience. I strongly recommend working with Chirag!
                    Riva Health had a very ambitious animation design (motion + visual) that needed to run on GPU alongside other intense GPU-based processing. Going into the project, we were afraid the animation would compromise the quality of our signal processing or take away overhead from future GPU needs. Chirag was pulled into the project late, but immediately helped us understand and de-risk how we could pull off the UX we were looking for.
                    As with any design<>developer handoff, there's always concern that the design will be compromised or miss the mark of what the design team intended (yet knew was overly ambitious). With Chirag's help, we were able to capture the true essence and emotive qualities of the design in the end result and the entire company from CEO downwards said it was "their favorite app update" by far.
                    Chirag went even further by optimizing code performance so our research teams would have plenty of GPU overhead to work with. This speaks to not only his care for the craft of UX, but also to the needs of being responsible with device resources—a quality not many developers can achieve in balance.
                    We look forward to working with Chirag on future efforts and recommend you do the same!

                    We engaged with Chirag to work on a difficult exploratory project that we weren't confident was technically feasible.  Working quite independently, Chirag researched, architected, developed, and tested a code library that solved the problem beautifully.  That code is now part of our production app.  It was quite an achievement.
                    Putting aside the results, it was a joy to work with Chirag.  In addition to being extremely bright, [They are] an excellent communicator and an all-around wonderful person to interact with. - Ken Hirsh

                    Hi Chirag,

                    Wanted to write to you and let you know how grateful we are for your work as a developer for our application. Not only did you analyze our codebase and contribute to missing documentation, your diligence in testing and solution finding lead us to hiring a project manager. Through your description of what was needed, assistance in the interview process, and collaborative work in hiring, we found a project manager who has been able to ramp our our development team. Our application is so much stronger because of your work and influence. Thank you again; we will definitely be reaching out in the future as needed!
