# About
I am a seasoned startup software engineer and I love solving hard problems. I have a strong understanding of the developing lifecycle. In addition to full-stack web development, I've worked on systems, and Apple platforms.  The debugger is an old friend of mine, and I enjoy a deep dive into the low-level realms. I have 15 years of experience at startup companies of different sizes, and some of my own. I've be hired as the 1st engineer, the 8th, and 80th.
