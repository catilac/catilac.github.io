# About
I am a seasoned startup software engineer and I love solving hard problems. I have a strong understanding of the developing lifecycle. In addition to full-stack web development, I've worked on systems, and Apple platforms.  The debugger is an old friend of mine, and I enjoy a deep dive into the low-level realms. I have 15 years of experience at startup companies of different sizes, and some of my own. I've be hired as the 1st engineer, the 8th, and 80th.

Hirsh Group, Lead Software Engineer, Jan 2021 - May 2021
Ported Soundpipe library from C to Swift. Performance work. They wanted a critical pitch detection library they relied on to be implemented in a language their engineers could understand. It needed to run FFTs and associated audio analysis just as fast as the C version. The code to this day runs in their app in the app store.

Riva Health, Lead Graphics Programmer, July 2021 - Sep 2021, Jan 2022 - March 2022
GPU pipeline optimization, code review before seeking FDA approval of code, and implemented animation idea using metal shaders. Riva was performing blood pressure monitoring using the iPhone camera on the GPU using compute shaders. While they were running that calculation, they also wanted an animation for the user to look at. I built one using graphics shaders on the GPU. I then made sure both operations were able to run performantly, and increased performance head room for
future development. I reviewed how they were using the GPU, improved the usage to best practices, and removed all warnings and flags around improper usage.
Technologies Used: Swift, xcode debugger, Metal

Building engineering org. SunHaus is a film company, and not a software development firm. But they were getting into the software industry unintentionally when they decided to build a novel film editor. I guided them in building a sustainable software organization that was more than
hiring a consultant every now and then to build new features. The code needed to be refactored, documented, tested, and the product needed to be managed by someone not buried in code.
Technologies Used: Swift,
